# Draft for Firefox

This is a port of the [Draft extension](http://github.com/n8/draft_extension) for Chrome to Firefox.

You can install it [directly from the repository](https://github.com/gjulianm/draft_ff/raw/master/draft_ff.xpi).

**Note**: This addon doesn't work in private browsing mode.

## How to use

Just press the button on the addon bar, and select *new* or *previous* to start editing on a new document or to open a previously opened one. There's also a button in the navigation bar.

If you are a keyboard guy, press Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + O to start editing in a new Draft document instantaneously.
